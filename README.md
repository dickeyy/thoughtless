# Thoughtless

_Forked from [pacocoursey/thoughtless](https://github.com/pacocoursey/thoughtless)_

I interpret this as a simple daily journal to dump your thoughts into. This was originally made by
[Paco](https://github.com/pacocoursey), you can visit their version [Here](https://thoughtless.paco.me).

My changes to their version are subtle but mainly I wanted to add the ability to backspace. Paco intentionally disabled
backspace, I'm assuming to encourage raw thought dumping, however, it triggered my OCD not being able to fix typos, so I
added it back in.

You can try my version [Here](https://thoughtless.kyle.so).
